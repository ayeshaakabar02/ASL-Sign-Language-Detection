📖 Project Overview:
This project focuses on building an Automatic American Sign Language (ASL) Detection system using Deep Learning. The system is designed to recognize hand signs from images and predict the corresponding ASL alphabet.
The main goal of this project is to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and others by using modern AI techniques. The complete project is developed and tested in Visual Studio Code, and the final deployment is done using Streamlit, which provides an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

🧠 Technologies & Tools Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Deep Learning (CNN-based models)
Streamlit (for web application)
OpenCV
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
VS Code (development environment)

🧪 Models Used
The project includes multiple trained deep learning models for comparison and performance evaluation:
Xception
MobileNetV2
NASNetMobile
Due to GitHub file size limitations, trained models are hosted externally.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a balanced American Sign Language (ASL) image dataset, containing labeled images for ASL alphabets.
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and is not uploaded to GitHub due to its large size.

🌐 Web Application (Streamlit)
For enhancement and better user interaction, this project includes a Streamlit-based web application.
The application allows users to:
Upload an image of a hand sign
Get real-time predictions
View model performance and results in an interactive way.
